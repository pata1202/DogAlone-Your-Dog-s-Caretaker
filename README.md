## ‚úèÔ∏è Abstract
In modern households, dogs have become more than just pets‚Äîthey are now regarded as members of the family. As of 2022, the number of registered dogs in Korea has reached approximately 3.02 million. However, a significant number of dogs are left alone for more than 5 hours a day on average, experiencing issues such as loneliness, separation anxiety, and excessive barking.

To address these challenges, many dog owners resort to measures like leaving the TV or lights on or using automatic feeders. However, these solutions often fall short of resolving the root problem, and financial constraints can make sending dogs to daycare an impractical option.

To solve this issue, our team developed DogAlone, an application that analyzes a dog's barking to determine its emotional state and provides tailored smart home solutions. According to research, a dog‚Äôs bark conveys emotional and behavioral intentions depending on its frequency and rhythm. Using this insight, our application employs real-time AI analysis to monitor a dog's condition and recommend appropriate responses. Through DogAlone, we aim to alleviate the difficulties of managing dogs left alone at home and enhance the well-being of both pets and their owners.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Proposal
With the increase in single-person households and DINKs (dual-income, no-kids families), the number of pet-owning households has risen. However, due to busy schedules, pet owners find it difficult to care for their dogs all day, resulting in many dogs being left alone. While Samsung and LG have introduced smart home appliances with pet care modes, these products have limitations in real-time management, and although AI technology for analyzing dog barking sounds has advanced, it has rarely been used to address social issues.

Our team was inspired by the idea that a dog's barking carries different meanings depending on its form. We aim to analyze the dog's barking sounds in real-time to understand its emotions and enable appropriate responses through a smart home system. Additionally, by organizing the data on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, we will help users understand their dog's emotional state and find suitable solutions. The app will also provide various features to remotely manage the dog. Pet owners using our app will be able to feel as though they are with their dog, even when they are away from home.
